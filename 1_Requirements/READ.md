To undertake these challenges, this paper focuses on two parts of quiz games, which are the gameplay of quiz games, and the questioning part of quiz games. For each part, this study attempts to figure out the reasonable game progress model to derive an appropriate measure of game refinement. The data have been collected using a variety of methods. For example, some data were collected through playing the game itself in order to identify the gameplay of quiz games, while some data were obtained from reliable sources on the internet.
